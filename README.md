# Machine Learning Classification Project

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the *Mathematical Modelling for Machine Learning* course at *Bocconi University*. The objective was to classify a randomly generated dataset using **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** and **Logistic Regression**, as well as explore additional models to identify the best-performing classifier.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial data exploration and visualization to understand feature distributions and patterns.
- **Supervised Learning Algorithms**:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- **Additional Classifiers**: Compared other models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to optimize classification performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implemented techniques such as Grid Search and Random Search to fine-tune model parameters and improve classification accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation**: Used various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC) to assess model performance.
- **Prediction on Unlabeled Data**: Applied the best-performing model to make predictions on an unseen dataset.

## Results & Insights
- The **best-performing model** was identified based on cross-validation scores and performance metrics.
- **Feature importance** analysis provided insights into which attributes contributed most to the classification.
- The final model was successfully applied to predict labels for an unseen dataset.
